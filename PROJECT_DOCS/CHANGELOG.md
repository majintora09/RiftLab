### Changed

- Structured note rendering now displays multiple DHC/assist items as lists instead of merging them into one paragraph.
- Imported note cleanup now repairs common glued label boundaries such as missing separators before `Neutral`, `Control`, `Damage`, `Mix`, `Support`, and similar content headings.
- Mobile Team Builder cards now use compact horizontal cards instead of tall showcase cards.
- Knowledge Map mobile navigation is collapsible while desktop remains open.
- Established `PROJECT_DOCS` as the primary project memory and source of truth instead of chat history.
- Documented how future feature requests should move through `FUTURE_IDEAS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `TASK_REQUEST.md`.
- Replaced giant flat tag dropdown behavior with grouped filter categories:
  - Position.
  - Playstyle.
  - Team Role.
  - Assist Type.
  - Team Needs.
- Renamed the public `Network` tab/label to `Knowledge Map`.
- Improved Knowledge Map empty-state and generic relationship copy so it explains connections or missing data more clearly.
- DHC notes now render as structured blocks instead of raw paragraph dumps when source data exists.
- Assist notes now render as structured blocks with Provides, Best For, Why, and Tags.
- Tags are normalized before rendering as chips or filters, removing duplicates, trailing periods, sentence-like tags, comma-heavy fragments, and obvious imported PDF leftovers.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md`, `FEATURES.md`, and `CONTENT_GUIDELINES.md` to treat Phase 1 formatting as implemented.
- Expanded project docs so they preserve implementation details and planning context.
- Documented tag quality rules:
  - Use short concepts like Pressure, Mix, Battery.
  - Do not use sentence-like tags.
- Documented DHC note structure:
  - Who likes DHCing into this.
  - Why.
  - Who this character likes DHCing into.
  - Why.
  - Special interactions.
- Documented assist note structure:
  - Provides.
  - Best For.
  - Why.
  - Tags.
- Documented grouped filter, Knowledge Map naming, Movie Room structure, and admin inline editing expectations in `CONTENT_GUIDELINES.md`.

### Notes

- Future feature work should update these docs during the same pass.
- `CONTENT_GUIDELINES.md` remains the compact formatting reference.
- The main docs now include the content philosophy so planning and implementation stay aligned.
