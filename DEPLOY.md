# Deploying FG Lab

FG Lab builds to a completely static `dist` folder for Cloudflare Pages. Production hosting does not need Node, a server, a database, or a paid service.

## Build Locally

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
```

Build output: `dist`

Optional local preview:

```powershell
npm run preview
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.

## Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages can deploy the repository on its free plan.

For the focused GitHub -> Cloudflare walkthrough, see `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES.md`.

1. Push the project to GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare, open **Workers & Pages** and create a Pages project.
3. Connect the GitHub repository.
4. Use these build settings:
   - Framework preset: `None`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `dist`
   - Root directory: leave blank
   - Node version: `20`
5. Deploy.

No environment variables are required for a normal `*.pages.dev` deployment. The generated `_redirects` file provides the static fallback, and physical route pages keep direct links refreshable.

## Static Route Support

The build generates physical `index.html` files for:

- FG Lab home and roadmap.
- All DBFZ portal routes.
- All current 2XKO portal routes.
- 2XKO Research Vault and Synergy Engine.

It also generates:

- `dist/_redirects` for Cloudflare Pages fallback.
- `dist/build-info.json` with the root base path and generated route list.

## Deployment Boundaries

- No paid service is required.
- No database is required.
- No production server process is required.
- `server.js` is only a local preview helper.
- Dustloop imports remain a local content preparation step, not live production scraping.
- GitHub is the source repository; Cloudflare Pages is the only production deployment target.
